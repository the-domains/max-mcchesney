            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Interview: Artist Ryan McGinness on Designing for Hennessy</h1><p>Despite the fact that he works across multiple artistic mediums, it's very easy to discern the work of NYC-based artist Ryan McGinness. In addition to his iconic symbol-driven body of work, his experimental Instagram and the depths of his oftentimes ornate paintings, McGinness recently took to designing a special limited edition bottle for luxury cognac brand Hennessy.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b0177dec01e85895d69f554c2d73fc2a73857261.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>7 Pimm's Cup recipes for spring.</h1><p>If Spring had an official cocktail, the Pimm's Cup would be it. It's ultra-refreshing, bright and vibrant-and as easy to make as it is to drink. To mix a basic version of the classic British cocktail, all you need is Pimm's No. 1, ginger ale (or some sort of lemon-lime soda), cucumber and lemon.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/81e7943555bcd38f0d3a304708ede962df3f224f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
